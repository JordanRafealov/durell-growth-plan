# Growth Plan Brief — Durell Patrick (Virtual Family Office)

## Instructions for Jordan

You are presenting a **Growth Plan** to Durell Patrick, a financial optimization consultant who runs a Virtual Family Office in Oakland/SF.

**This is a DEMONSTRATION call, not a discovery call.** Discovery is done. You need to SHOW Durell:
1. The quantified gap between where he is and where he wants to be
2. The system (podcast method, LinkedIn outbound, cold email engine, AI automations)
3. The ROI math that makes $15K feel like a rounding error
4. The path forward (pricing, guarantee, timeline, next steps)

**Tone:** Confident but not pushy. Expert advisor, not salesman. Use "when" not "if." Reference specific numbers from discovery. Hormozi-style value stacking.

**Call Details:**
- Date: Thursday, February 6, 2026
- Time: 12:00 PM Bangkok / 9:00 PM PST
- Format: Video call
- Duration target: 45-60 minutes
- Goal: Close at $15K for 90-day engagement, or $6K x 3 split

## The Hard Truth About Durell

**Durell is scattered.** He mentioned 15 different things on the call — college funding, tax planning, acquisitions, the "wheel," partnerships with Jordan, building systems for his advisors, life insurance, retirement planning, the $180K exit package, the $65K retreat guy, his business partner, marketing for lenders, marketing for CPAs, marketing for insurance agents, and AI collapsing timeframes.

**This is a red flag for two reasons:**

1. **His business isn't focused** — which means our system will be harder to dial in. If we can't lock him into one clear ICP and one clear offer, the outbound messaging will be vague and conversion will suffer.
2. **He might be a tire-kicker** — all that talk about "partnerships" and doing outreach "for everybody on the wheel" instead of focusing on HIS pipeline is a classic pattern. He's more excited about the vision than doing the work.

**But the money is real if we can cut through his noise.** The trucking company case study ($600K savings, $3M enterprise value, 10% equity verbal) is proof he can deliver massive outcomes. The exit package at $180K is a legitimate high-ticket offer. The life insurance angle ($400K-$800K per client) is enormous. The problem isn't his ability to deliver — it's his inability to focus on one thing long enough to build a pipeline around it.

**Jordan's job on this call:** Contain his scatter. Every time he goes broad ("I want this for the whole wheel"), bring him back to: "We start with YOUR pipeline. Prove it. Then replicate." If he can't agree to that, he'll be a nightmare client who wants 10 things at once and gets zero results.

## Durell's ACTUAL ICP (Distilled From the Noise)

Two buyer types, one core problem:

### Buyer A: Post-Acquisition Business Owner

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Who** | Business owner who just acquired a company |
| **Situation** | Used SBA loan or debt to buy ($2-6M borrowed) |
| **Problem** | Profitable but bleeding cash to debt service |
| **Need** | Optimize profits/taxes to cover debt AND grow |
| **Life Event Trigger** | Closed an acquisition in the last 6-12 months |
| **What Durell Does** | Restructures debt and taxes, finds hidden savings (like the $600K for the trucking company), frees up capital to service debt and make further acquisitions |
| **Durell's Value** | Turns a 10-year growth plan into 5 years without using additional capital |

### Buyer B: Pre-Exit Business Owner

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Who** | Profitable business owner who also owns real estate |
| **Situation** | Planning to sell in 12-24 months |
| **Problem** | Won't net enough from sale at current valuation |
| **Need** | Boost enterprise value by $1-3M before exit |
| **Life Event Trigger** | Started exit planning conversations with broker, accountant, or attorney |
| **What Durell Does** | Pre-exit optimization — boost value, reduce tax liability, structure the sale to maximize walkaway number |
| **Durell's Value** | The difference between "sold for $6M, netted $800K" and "sold for $9M, netted $3M" |

### Industries (his stated best fits)
- Medical / Dental / Surgery practices
- Trucking / Logistics
- Hospitality
- Assisted Living
- Construction
- Architectural / Engineering firms

### Why These Two Buyers Are The Right Focus

1. **Highest LTV** — Post-acquisition clients stay for years (tax planning $23K/yr + ongoing optimization). Pre-exit clients lead to the $180K exit package.
2. **Clear trigger events** — "Just bought a business" and "starting to plan exit" are identifiable, timeable events we can target in outbound.
3. **Referral partners find them naturally** — SBA lenders see Buyer A every day. Business brokers see Buyer B every day. The "Wheel" becomes a referral engine once Durell proves the system works on direct outreach.
4. **The messaging writes itself** — "Just bought a business? We'll find $500K+ in savings to cover your debt service." / "Planning to exit? We'll boost your enterprise value by $1-3M before you sell."

### What Durell Should NOT Be Selling Right Now
- College funding ($4,300/year — too low-value for outbound to make sense)
- General tax planning (too vague, no trigger event)
- Marketing for the "Wheel" advisors (premature — build his own pipeline first)
- Partnership deals (no bandwidth, keep it simple: paid engagement)
- Life insurance (not yet — this comes AFTER the relationship is established with Buyer A or B)

## The Gap (Quantified)

### Current State -> Future State
```
CURRENT:  $15,000/month   ($180K/year)
GOAL:     $167,000/month  ($2,000,000/year)
GAP:      $152,000/month  ($1,820,000/year)
```

### Problem Impact Cost (PIC)
Every month Durell stays referral-dependent:
- **$152K/month in unrealized revenue**
- **~$90K/month in unrealized profit** (assuming ~60% margins on advisory work)
- **Over 12 months: $1.08M in lost profit**
- **Compounding cost:** SBA just changed, tax bill just changed — massive opportunity window that competitors will capture first

### The Math That Makes $15K Obvious
| Scenario | Calculation | Return on $15K |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Win 1 tax/acquisition client | 1 x $23K/year | 1.5x ROI (first year alone) |
| Win 1 exit package client | 1 x $180K | **12x ROI** |
| Win 2 good clients | 2 x $40K avg LTV | 5.3x ROI |
| Win 1 life insurance referral | $400K-$800K | **26-53x ROI** |
| Combined (3 clients + 1 exit) | $120K + $180K = $300K | **20x ROI** |

### TAM Opportunity
- Tens of thousands of business owners making $300K+ in his target industries across the US
- Thousands of commercial lenders, business brokers, and CPAs who could become referral partners
- Durell currently has 18 clients — essentially 0% market penetration
- Even capturing 10-15 new clients in 90 days at $40K avg LTV = $400K-$600K in lifetime revenue
- **One exit package client ($180K) covers the investment 12x over**

## G.A.P.S.C. Presentation Framework

### Phase 1: The Promise (2 min)

**Script:**
> "Durell, thanks for jumping on again. I spent hours putting this together for you. Here's what I'm going to show you today: a detailed plan to install a demand engine into your business — the missing piece you talked about yesterday. By the end of this call, you'll see exactly how we take you from $180K to $2M using the exact system Hormozi recommends, fully done-for-you, with AI agents handling the heavy lifting. I'll show you the math, the system, and what it costs. Sound good?"

### Phase 2: Case Studies (5 min)

Show 2-3 relevant case studies. These are already in the presentation — CreateStudio, HelloCustom, MediaPlace AI, Ripple & Goldphish.

**Script:**
> "Before I get into your specific plan, let me quickly show you what this looks like in practice. These are businesses I've personally worked with..."

**Transition after case studies:**
> "Now, none of these are financial services companies — but the pattern is identical. Professional services business, high-value clients, referral-dependent, needed a predictable growth engine. Sound familiar?"

### Phase 3: Why Most Outbound Fails (3 min)

**The 97/3 Problem:**
> "Durell, at any given time, only about 3% of business owners are actively looking for someone like you. Those are the people who find you through your M&A group. The other 97% — they have a need, they're overpaying in taxes, they're leaving money on the table in their exits — but they haven't started looking yet. Cold outreach burns that 97% because it screams 'buy now.' What we do instead is use a podcast to open doors — you invite them on as an expert, build genuine rapport, and when they ARE ready, you're already the trusted advisor. That's the difference between chasing leads and attracting clients."

### Phase 4: Gap #1 — No Demand Engine (5 min)

**Present the numbers (don't ask — you already know them):**
> "Right now, your business generates about $180K a year — all from referrals in your M&A group. 18 clients, 2-3 new ones a month. Your goal is $2 million. That's a $152K/month gap — roughly $1.8 million per year in revenue you're not capturing.
>
> The issue isn't your service — you found $600K in savings for a trucking company, you're getting verbal agreements for 10% equity in holdings. The issue is distribution. You have no system to predictably reach the thousands of business owners who match your exact profile — profitable, own real estate, looking to acquire or exit.
>
> And here's what makes this expensive: every month without a system, that's $90K+ in profit left on the table. Not because you can't deliver — because they've never heard of you."

**Confirming question:**
> "Does that gap feel accurate to you?"

### Phase 5: Gap #2 — No Trust or Authority System (5 min)

**Script:**
> "The second gap is trust. You told me yesterday about the agency that ran ads where 9 out of 10 leads said they never filled anything out. You hired someone for LinkedIn DMs — unclear results. Those aren't just wasted money, Durell — they burned your trust in the process.
>
> Here's the thing: business owners making $300K+ who are thinking about acquiring a company or exiting one — they don't respond to cold spam. They respond to authority. Someone they've seen on a podcast, someone who's published case studies showing $600K in tax savings, someone Eddie Maloof and Nat Green's circles are talking about.
>
> Right now, when someone Googles your name or checks your LinkedIn, what do they find? Is there content? Case studies? A podcast where you're interviewing business owners who've done exactly what your clients want to do? That authority layer is what turns a cold contact into a warm conversation."

### Phase 6: Gap #3 — No Systems for Scale (5 min)

**Script:**
> "The third gap is what you told me yourself yesterday — 'I need systems so that we can do the intake, the lending, the accounting, the insurance. This is the missing link.'
>
> You have 18 clients and no intake system. No CRM tracking your pipeline. No automated follow-up. No nurture sequences keeping warm leads engaged. When someone shows interest but isn't ready for 3 months — what happens? They disappear.
>
> And here's the big one: you mentioned wanting this system for everyone on the wheel — lenders, brokers, insurance agents, CPAs. But you can't scale what you haven't built. We need to install the engine for YOUR pipeline first, prove it works, then replicate it across the wheel."

### Phase 7: Cost of Inaction (5 min)

**Guide Durell through the math:**

> "Let me walk through some numbers. Tell me if these feel right.
>
> Your exit package is worth $180,000. Your average tax and acquisition client is worth $23,000 a year. A good client over 12-24 months is worth $30,000 to $50,000. And you mentioned the life insurance angle — $400K to $800K per client.
>
> Now, there are thousands of business owners in the Bay Area alone — medical, dental, trucking, construction, assisted living — who match your exact profile. You have 18 clients. If we helped you win just 4 new clients per month at $40K average LTV — which is what the math says you need for $2M — what does that add?"

*(Let him calculate: 4/month x 12 months x $40K = $1.92M — that's the $2M run rate)*

> "So the difference between doing something and doing nothing is the difference between staying at $180K and hitting $2M. And that's before we count the exit packages and life insurance commissions.
>
> Can you see why staying referral-dependent is the most expensive decision you could make right now?"

### Phase 7.5: The Offer Clarity Moment (5 min) — CRITICAL

**This is the hardest part of the call.** You need to tell Durell his offer is a mess — diplomatically but directly. This is what separates you from every other agency he could hire.

**Script:**
> "Durell, before I show you the system, I need to be straight with you. On our call yesterday, you mentioned seven different things you do — tax savings, debt restructuring, acquisitions, exits, college funding, the exit package, systems for the whole wheel. Your pricing ranges from $4,300 to $180,000.
>
> Here's the thing: you can't build a demand engine for someone who can't answer 'What do you sell and to whom?' Right now, you have a practice — not an offer. And outbound doesn't work for practices. It works for specific problems with specific buyers.
>
> So before we turn on a single channel, the FIRST thing we do is constrain you down to ONE offer and ONE buyer. Here's what I think that looks like..."

**Transition to the offer:**
> "The only thing you said yesterday that sounded like a real, sellable, high-value offer was this: 'We help business owners who just acquired a company find $300K-$600K in annual savings within 90 days — enough to cover your debt service and fund your next move.'
>
> THAT is specific. That's a clear before and after. That's a triggering life event — they just closed an acquisition. We can target that. We can message that. We can build a pipeline around that.
>
> College funding at $4,300? That's a nice add-on for existing clients, not something you run outbound for. The wheel? That's Phase 2 — after YOUR pipeline is proven. The exit package at $180K? That's the upsell once you've established the relationship through the acquisition optimization.
>
> One ICP. One offer. Everything else comes after. Are you with me on that?"

**If he pushes back:**
> "Durell, I can build you the best outbound system in the world, but if the message is 'I do seven things for anyone who has money,' it won't convert. The agencies that failed you before? I guarantee their messaging was vague because your offer was vague. Let me fix that first."

**Why this matters for Jordan:** If he can't agree to focus, he'll be a nightmare client. This is also a test — if he says "yes, let's focus," he's coachable and worth taking on. If he keeps drifting to the wheel and partnerships, consider whether this is a $15K client or a $15K headache.

### Phase 8: The Solution — Three-Pillar System (10 min)

**Channel 1: LinkedIn Dream 500 Precision Play (for business owners)**
> "For business owners — your buyers — we're NOT doing volume. We're doing precision.
>
> Here's the approach: there are 4,000+ business owners on LinkedIn right now matching your exact ICP — medical practices, trucking, hospitality, construction — Owner, Founder, CEO level, 11-500 employees. I'll show you the screenshot.
>
> But we're not blasting all 4,000. We're hand-picking 50-100 per month — the Dream 500. Here's what makes this different:
> 1. We use LinkedIn's 'Changed Jobs' filter to catch business owners who just acquired or just transitioned — that's your Buyer A trigger event happening in real time
> 2. Each prospect gets a personalized Loom video from you — 60 seconds, referencing their specific business, their industry, their situation
> 3. The best prospects get invited onto your podcast — flattering, not salesy, and it creates a real relationship
> 4. After the podcast, you BAMFAM it — book the strategy call while the rapport is fresh
>
> The math: 50-100 hand-picked connections per month → 15-40 warm conversations → 4-14 podcast recordings or direct calls → 8-15 strategy calls in 90 days. At your $40K average LTV, that's $320K-$600K in pipeline from LinkedIn alone.
>
> Why precision, not volume? Because a business owner deciding whether to trust you with $180K doesn't respond to automated connection requests. They respond to someone who took 60 seconds to record a video about THEIR business. That's the difference."

**Channel 2: Cold Email (for referral partners + volume)**
> "For referral partners — commercial lenders, business brokers, CPAs, insurance agents — we use automated cold email at scale.
>
> 1. We build targeted lists of professionals who serve your same client base
> 2. AI-personalized sequences that position you as a value-add partner, not a competitor
> 3. Proper infrastructure: 8-12 warmed domains, no burned addresses, deliverability monitoring
> 4. AI handles reply classification — your inbox isn't flooded with manual work
>
> This is what failed before with the ad agency. They ran ads to strangers with no infrastructure, no trust, no follow-up. We fix that systematically."

**Channel 3: Podcast Authority Engine (supports both)**
> "The podcast does triple duty:
> 1. Opens doors to business owner relationships (invite them as guests)
> 2. Creates content that positions you as THE authority in business optimization and exits
> 3. Gives you LinkedIn content — clips of you talking about $600K tax savings, acquisition strategies, exit optimization
>
> You said it yourself yesterday: 'I do financing and I free up money and I help people take freed up capital to collapse timeframes to reach their goals. That's the simplified message I need to get out there.' The podcast IS how you get that message out there."

**In-house comparison:**
> "If you tried to build this yourself:
> - One SDR in the Bay Area: $6-8K/month salary + commission
> - Cold email tools (Instantly, domains, data): $500/month
> - LinkedIn automation (Sales Nav + HeyReach): $400/month
> - Podcast production (editor, distribution): $2-3K/month
> - AI automation engineer: $8-10K/month
>
> You're looking at $17-22K/month MINIMUM for a team that doesn't exist yet and has zero track record. With us, you get a proven system, a 5-person team, AND AI automation — with a guarantee."

### Phase 10: The Guarantee (3 min)

**Script:**
> "Most agencies won't guarantee results. You experienced that firsthand — the ad agency that generated fake leads? No guarantee. The LinkedIn DM person? No guarantee.
>
> Here's mine: We will generate a minimum of 25 qualified conversations in 90 days. That means real conversations with business owners who match your ICP — profitable, own real estate, looking to acquire or exit — who have a genuine need for what you do.
>
> If we don't hit 25, we keep working — for free — until we do. No extra charges.
>
> At your average client LTV of $40K, 25 conversations at even a conservative 15% close rate = 3-4 new clients = $120-160K in lifetime value from a $15K investment. And that's before we count exit packages or life insurance."

### Phase 11: Investment Options (3 min)

**Option A: Pay in Full — $15,000**
- Full system build + 90 days managed execution
- All AI automations included
- 25+ qualified conversations guaranteed
- $300K+ pipeline guaranteed
- Save $3,000 vs. split

**Option B: Split Payment — $6,000 x 3**
- $6,000 Day 1 — Infrastructure Sprint
- $6,000 Day 31
- $6,000 Day 61
- Total: $18,000
- Same deliverables, same guarantee

**Script:**
> "There are two ways to work together. Option A is pay-in-full at $15,000 — you save $3,000 and we start immediately. Option B is a split payment — $6,000 to start, then two more payments at Day 31 and Day 61.
>
> For context: one SDR in the Bay Area costs $6-8K/month with zero guarantee. You told me yesterday that $15K sounds fair and if you get one $180K client it's worth it. I agree. One exit package client and this investment is paid back 12 times over."

### Phase 12: Close (5-10 min)

**Pre-close (he already said yes yesterday — this is a confirmation, not a new pitch):**
> "Durell, you told me yesterday — 'Of course I'd take it. $15K sounds fair. If we get one $180K client, it'd be worth it.' You were on the call at 11pm because this matters. So let's make it happen."

**Close script:**
> "Which makes more sense for you — the pay-in-full at $15K, or the split payment starting at $6K?"

*(Let him choose — both are wins)*

**Lock the start date:**
> "Perfect. The first 14 days are infrastructure — domains warming, lists building, podcast setup. So the sooner we start, the sooner outreach goes live. I can kick off onboarding Monday or Tuesday. Which works better?"

**If he says "I need to think about it":**
> "Durell, you said last night at 11pm that you need this done like yesterday. What specifically are you thinking through? Let's address it right now so you can make a confident decision."

**If he brings up price:**
> "One exit package client is $180K. One life insurance client is $400-800K. This investment is $15K. If this system lands you ONE of either, you've made 12-53x your money. And we're guaranteeing 25 conversations. The real question isn't 'can I afford $15K' — it's 'can I afford to leave $1.8 million per year on the table?'"

**If he wants to start with the wheel (marketing for everyone):**
> "I love that vision — and that's exactly where this goes. But here's why we start with YOUR pipeline: we need to prove the system works, dial in the messaging, get the first wins. Once we have that proof, replicating it for your lenders, brokers, and insurance agents is just copy-paste with new targeting. Let's get YOU to $2M first, then we'll spider out to the wheel."

**If he mentions his business partner:**
> "That's great — once we prove this works for you, she goes through the exact same process. That could be engagement #2. But let's focus on getting YOUR engine running first."

## Objection Handling Reference

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"I need to think about it"** | "You were on the call at 11pm last night. What specifically needs thinking through? Let's address it now." |
| **"$15K is a lot"** | "One exit package client is $180K — that's 12x return. One life insurance referral is $400-800K. We guarantee 25 conversations. The expensive option is doing nothing at $1.8M/year in unrealized revenue." |
| **"I got burned by an agency before"** | "That's exactly why we built this differently. Those guys ran ads to strangers with no infrastructure. We build you an owned system — the domains, scripts, AI agents, podcast — it's all yours. And we guarantee results or work for free." |
| **"Can I start with just the podcast?"** | "The channels work together — LinkedIn opens doors, cold email drives volume, podcast creates authority. One alone gets partial results. The $15K is for the engine, not one piece of it." |
| **"What if it doesn't work?"** | "Then we keep working for free until it does. 25 qualified conversations guaranteed. I take the risk, not you." |
| **"I want to do this for the whole wheel first"** | "The wheel is the vision — and we'll get there. But we start with YOUR pipeline because that's where the $2M goal lives. Once proven, we replicate for every spoke on the wheel." |
| **"My business partner should do this too"** | "Absolutely — she'd be engagement #2. Let's prove it on you first, then onboard her with the same system." |
| **"The timing isn't right"** | "SBA just changed. Tax bill just changed. You said there's a huge opportunity window right now. The first 14 days are just infrastructure warmup. Starting now means you're live in February." |

## Key Quotes to Reference (from yesterday's call)

Use these to anchor the conversation — he said these things:

- **"Of course I'd take it. $15K sounds fair."**
- **"If we get one $180K client, it'd be worth it."**
- **"I need to get this done like yesterday."**
- **"I wouldn't be here at 11 o'clock at night if it wasn't important."**
- **"I need somebody like you, Alex, Eddie Maloof to fix what we're doing so we can scale."**
- **"I need systems so that we can do the intake, the lending, the accounting, the insurance. This is the missing link."**
- **"I do financing and I free up money and I help people take freed up capital to collapse timeframes to reach their goals. That's the simplified message I need to get out there."**

## Closing Advantage: He Already Said Yes

This is NOT a typical growth plan close. Durell already:
1. Said "$15K sounds fair" and "of course I'd take it"
2. Stayed on the call until 11pm his time
3. Booked the follow-up immediately with zero hesitation
4. Said "I need this done like yesterday"
5. Calculated his own ROI ("if we get one $180K client, it'd be worth it")

**Your job tonight is NOT to sell him. It's to:**
1. Show the detailed plan so he feels confident in the system
2. Remind him of his own words and commitment
3. Handle any new objections that came up since yesterday
4. Get payment and lock the onboarding date

**This is a confirmation call, not a pitch. Act accordingly.**
